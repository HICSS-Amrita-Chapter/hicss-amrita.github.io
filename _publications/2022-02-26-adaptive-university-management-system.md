excerpt: 'The true power and the state of any technology are best known during difficult times. The yet-to-over COVID-19 lockdown has unleashed the power of online and remote modes of learning, evaluation, and working. The universities and educational institutions worldwide faced their big-time challenge in delivering, managing, evaluating their student’s learning progress. The need for an online-virtual-remote learning platform has become inevitable, which comes with a multitude of challenges, including usability, security, privacy, and real-time adoption.'

The true power and the state of any technology are best known during difficult times. The yet-to-over COVID-19 lockdown has unleashed the power of online and remote modes of learning, evaluation, and working. The universities and educational institutions worldwide faced their big-time challenge in delivering, managing, evaluating their student’s learning progress. The need for an online-virtual-remote learning platform has become inevitable, which comes with a multitude of challenges, including usability, security, privacy, and real-time adoption. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive University Management System Framework (UMS) based on Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) like Ethereum Blockchain where we record the schedules, the delivered classes, the materials and track the student’s learning progress with the use of ERC-721 standard to tokenize the submissions & evaluations. To provide efficient and effective utilization, the learning materials and submissions made onto the system are stored in Distributed File Storage system - InterPlanetary File System (IPFS) and hosted in InterPlanetary Name System (IPNS) with files securely split using a secret sharing algorithm.
