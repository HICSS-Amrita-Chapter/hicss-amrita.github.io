Identity management is an inevitable part of the proper delivery of schemes and services to individuals by the government and private organizations. Identity management encompasses the creation and maintenance of identity. It ensures that the right entity gains access to the right resources at the right time for verification. It also involves providing high security, privacy, productivity, and enhanced user experience. Rising incidents of data infringements and identity thefts in a centralized identity system are a growing concern. Blockchain-based identity solutions gained a competitive edge over the present centralized identity system due to the features of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) and Verifiable Claims (VC). In this paper, we investigate various blockchain-based identity solutions that are self-sovereign and can create VC. We have also analyzed and proposed to create a user-centric identity and claims using ERC-725 and ERC-780 Ethereum standards powered by IPFS for distributed data storage.
