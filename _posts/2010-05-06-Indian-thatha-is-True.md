"Indian is the Country where Gandhi, Buddha, Nehru and many noble people lived. This Sentence seems to be very old. But do we get the real meaning of what it is?"

Here i narrate a real life story happened a few hours ago. And its go like this.........

Few of my juniors, who completed 12th are planning to write entrance examination certificate conducted by IMU(Indian Maritime University). The entrance examination is to be held on May 30th for which the submission of application closes on may 14th. The norms says the community certificate must be in CENTERAL GOVERNMENT FORMAT.
IN Government Office:
The application form was recieved and all required details are filled out and submitted with all necessary document like Ration card Xerox,Community certificate Xerox were submitted. The certificate must be authorized by VAO, RI and Thasildar.

**IN VAO Office:**

Everyone of us will never forget the Indian Movie where Kamal Hassan(indian thatha) goes to the VAO for getting sign when kasturi was met with an accident. The exact scene went over here. We the students submitted the apllications and documents. The VAO turned all pages and said some documents is missing. [ Remember in the same movie actor senthil will say this word for signing the document]. Hope you would have found the missing document. Thats nothing but " MONEY ". He asks without any shame.
The dog also asked " எக்ஸாம் எல்லாம் எதுக்கு டா எழுதறிங்க ?".

When i heard this entire non-sense the words in the movie rolled in my mind." வெளிநாட்டுல எல்லாம் வேலை செய்யாம இறுக்க தான் லஞ்சம் , ஆனா இந்தியால வேலை பண்ண லஞ்சம் ".

In this is situation, those students are not in the position to fight back by saying "Why should we give money?" .( Though they asked to me "Why should we give money to that .......... ?") The best thing to do is get the sign by giving the amount 150 0r 100 he asked. That the best and better way.

This doesnt mean I encourage bribe, What as youngester we can do is when we work at any cost we must not do the same to someone. When this attitude fills the mind, atleast the upcoming generation will be bribeless... Because we cannot chnage those VAO or RI or any donkey who does,we have our own work, problems to face.

"The future of India is in the hands of Younger Generation.... Jai Hind".
