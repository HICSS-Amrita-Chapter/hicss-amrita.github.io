Michel de Nostredame was a French apothecary and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since become famous worldwide. He is best known for his book Les Propheties ("The Prophecies"), the first edition of which appeared in 1555.

There are many research,mysteries, secert in his Predictions about the future. Many among them happened as he said. As any other men of his time, he too used anagrams and other techniques to say his prediction about future.The predictions are not one or two, thousand greatest time predictions. He divided 100 predictions called century. So his prophecies contains 10 Centuries.

**Famous Predictions:**

**3 Antichrist:**

Nostradamus predicted that there will be three anti-christ, who will seduce the people with their greatness words and world will get into war once they die..

**1st Anti-christ, Nostradamus predicted was Napoleon Bonaparte.**

Pau, Nay, Loron will be more of fire than blood,
to swim in praise, the great one to flee to the confluence (of rivers).
He will refuse entry to the magpies
Pampon and the Durance will keep them confined.
this verses by Nostradamus says about Napoleon.

**Explanation:**
 
Pau, Nay , Loron are the countries in the Southwestern France. These three countries together represents the name which we are look for!.

PAU NAY LORON is an anagram for NAPAULON ROY, Who is nothing but
Napoleon Bonaparte.

**2nd Anti-christ, Nostradamus predicted was Adolf Hitler.**

Out of the deepest part of the west of Europe.
From poor people a young child shall be born.
Who with his tongue shall seduce many people
His fame will increase in the Eastern Kingdom.

In the year that is to come soon, and not far from Venus.
The two greatest ones of Asia and Africa.
Shall be said to come from the Rhine and Hister [Hitler]
Crying and tears shall be at Malta on the Italian Shore.

this verses by Nostradamus says about Hilter.

Adolph Hilter was born in Linz, Austria, which lies on the Danube River. Hister happens to be an ancient Latin word for the Danube River where he was born.

**3rd Anti-christ, Nostradamus predicted was MABUS:**

Mabus then will soon die, there will come
Of people and beasts a horrible rout:
Then suddenly one will see vengeance,
Hundred, hand, thirst, hunger when the comet will run.

this verses by Nostradamus says about Mabus.

This is the hot debating topic as of now.The Nostradamus uses cryptic verse to say the final Anti-christ. A number of notorious contemporary figures, still living or recently dead from the Middle East can see their names spelled in the Mabus code. But there also are other leaders from the West, deeply entangled in Middle Eastern turmoil, a current US president and a charismatic candidate who could be his successor whose names also easily decode out of Mabus, making the search for the right candidate the most provocative and topical challenge presented by Nostradamus for our present times.

So now you would have found that US President and Nobel Peace Prize winner is the 3rd Antichrist said by Nostradamus.

**Decryption goes as :**

OBAMA was preceeded by BUSH ==> OBAMA + BUSH

..... OBAMA + BUSH ==> OBAMABUSH.

The verses also say, once this man die, WORLD WAR III will soon commence!!!

Tin Tin Tu Tin!!!
