Taj Mahal is a mausoleum located in Agra, India, built by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal.Its believed that nearly it took 22 years to build one of the Wonder's of the World. Construction began around 1632 A.D. and was completed around 1653 A.D., and employed thousands of artisans and craftsmen.

Recently,  when I was discussing with my friends about Nostradamus and stuffs like that . They told me few shocking things about Taj Mahal, which  I never heard of.

I am bringing  those breath taking proofs (truths) to you exactly  how  I  read those.  The proofs are by Shri.P.N.Oak from his celebrated book titled " TAJ MAHAL: A TRUE STORY".

Firstly, TAJ MAHAL, lets analyse this name :

1. "Mahal" is never the ending used in any Islamic country or architecture.

2. The explanation given to the name was, its derived from " MUMTAJ MAHAL" as TAJ MAHAL. The fact is that her name is "MUMTAZ-UL-ZAMANI" not MUMTAJ. Even if its it should be TAZ MAHAL, where is the place for J coming in.

3. The term Taj Mahal is the corrupt form of TEJOMAHALAY, signifying a Shiva Temple.

I also bring here  few unseen and unnoticed picture of TAJ MAHAL, which is evident that so-claimed SHAH JAHAN is not the builder of so-called TRIBUTE TO HIS WIFE. 
Also, its must be a Shiva Temple or some pre-Shah Jahan period building. Either of these thing may be true .

</p>

This is the Pinnacle(top) of the Taj Mahal, resembles our temple KALASHAM. Shah Jahan placed  extra-moon to make it to look-like Islamic dome.

</p>

This is place where Shah Jahan body is buried inside Taj Mahal. The point is why have an octagonal screen around two graves? It is more likely to have been an area of where sacred activities once took place.

</p>

Inverted water-pots on top. Their number is always odd, 11 in this case, typical of the Vedic system. Notice also the cobra design in pairs below the gallery.

</p>

In a detail on the gate, we can see two elephantâ€™s trunks, one on either side of the design, which would indicate Ganesh.

</p>

Now you can see the 3 shape OM inscription in the wall.

</p>


On the main building, cobra designs in pairs at top of wall, another typical Vedic design. Graffiti in the form of Koranic inscriptions were added by Shahjahan.

Above pictures show that it was an ancient building,which was acquired by Shah Jahan and modified into Mausoleum.

The following pics will bring out the truth that the building was there early on and its was only modified as  Mausoleum.

Here you can see, not far from the plinth of the Taj, the stairway that goes down to the 22 rooms. It is surrounded by the red sandstone railing.

</p>

We are now outside the Cenotaph Chamber. Note how the steps in plain marble break up the designs on the plinth wall. This means that they are not original.

</p>

Palace in Barhanpur where Mumtaz died.

<p align="center">

</p>

Place where its said that Mumtaz body is buried.

Few Other notable facts:

1. Many don't easily believe things unless its proved scientifically.Here comes the scientific proof.  A wooden piece from the river side doorway of Taj Mahal was subjected to a CARBON-14 test by an American lab,which revealed that the door was 300 years older than Shah Jahan.It belongs to 1155.A.D. almost  500 years anterior.

2. The Taj Mahal faces South. If being, Islamic it should have faced west.

3. The entire Taj Mahal has 500 rooms nearly. Why should a Mausoleum have rooms?

4. At south east corner there is a cattle house, where cows of Shiva temple were there. There is no point cow in Islamic tomb.

5. Shah Jahan married many womens before and after Mumtaz dead. So she has no special place for building such a great TAJ MAHAL.

6. As said earlier, the complete construction work was spanned 22 years with 20,000 labourers. But there is not a scrap of paper like the design papers, daily expenditure sheets, bills.

</p>

7. This the well between so-called mosque and the drum house, which has a stair case reaching down to the water level.This is the traditional treasury well in hindu temple palaces.In case the treasure has be surrounded by the enemy, then the treasure is push into the well.This remained safe until the palace was reconquered.Such a well is unnecessary for a tomb.

</p>

8. These are the steps were Mullahs preach. But  we can see how this break the pattern in the wall, which means that the step was build later and not original.

There are numerous other facts but I hope these pictorial proofs would be enough for us!. Adding to which i must say, not only Taj Mahal but those structures said to be build by Shah Jahan were all ancient ones just modified by him.

Disclaimer:  This also doesn't mean to bring  another communal hatred.Only to say that Shah Jahan is not the man who gets the pride for building this great so-called Taj Mahal rather some other  Pre-Shah Jahan period architect (May be Hindu or Islam).
